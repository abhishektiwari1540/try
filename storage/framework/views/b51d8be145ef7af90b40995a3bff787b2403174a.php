            <p>A holistic health assessment with Dr Jain goes beyond focusing solely on physical health. The whole condition of the patient is taken into consideration to prepare the client for a more effective process of Self Transformation for ongoing wellness across all aspects of life. The development of a relationship with the patient begins with open, therapeutic communication. This supportive, non-judgmental method of assessment recognizes that the patient’s stress levels, diet and relationship issues can often exacerbate many ailments.
                The purpose of this assessment is to briefly highlight different layers of our existence, according to the ancient yogic wisdom, along with experience and understanding of them. Deepening awareness of these can evoke an expansion of life energy on all levels and point the way to a profound Truth that resides within us all – the Self.
